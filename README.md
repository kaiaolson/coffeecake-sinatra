# Coffee Cake
This responsive Sinatra web app generates a given number of divs and scales them to fit within the page width.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
First, make sure you have Sinatra installed:

<pre>gem install sinatra</pre>

Then run with: 

<pre>ruby coffee_cake_app.rb</pre>

View at: http://localhost:4567

It is recommended to also run <pre>gem install thin</pre>, which Sinatra will pick up if available.
